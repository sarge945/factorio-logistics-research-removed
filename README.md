Logistics Research Removed
==============

This mod completely disables the [Logistic System Research](https://wiki.factorio.com/Logistic_system_(research)), as I believe it makes belts largely obsolete and allows "brute forcing" bot solutions to complex logistics problems.

This mod aims to undermine using bots in place of logistics systems, without affecting the general improvements bots provide. As a result, The initial Logistics Research is still available, so Roboports, Construction Bots and Logistics Bots are still available, as are Passive Provider Chests and Storage Chests, allowing bots to still resupply the player and perform building and repair tasks.

This mod can be added and removed on existing savegames. In this case, the research will be hidden from the research screen, and all advanced chests will no longer be craftable or usable as recipes. Existing chests won't be affected, and any assemblers previously set up to create the advanced logistics chests will continue to function normally.

The mod can be easily activated/deactivated at any time.

The mod icon is adapted from the in-game Logistics research icon, available from the Factorio Wiki, and also uses the Wikimedia Commons "No" symbol, which is available under the public domain.
