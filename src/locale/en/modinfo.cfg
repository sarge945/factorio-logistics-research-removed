LogisticsResearchRemoved=Logistics Research Removed

[mod-description]
LogisticsResearchRemoved=Completely removes the second Logistics research, since I consider using robots to transport items around the factory overpowered. Roboports, Construction and Logistics robots are still available, and can still transfer items to/from the player, only the second tier Logistics research is disabled (no Buffer, Active Provider or Requestor chests). Additionally, if this research is completed in an existing game, these items will be hidden and can no longer be built. Vehicle Logistics are enabled with the base logistics bots research. Vehicles and Storage Chests can no longer have their items removed by inserters.

[mod-setting-description]
LogisticResearchRemovedAllowTank=Allow Tanks to request items from the logistics network. Items can no longer be removed from tanks via inserters, to prevent them from acting as makeshift buffer chests. Does not require the Logistics 2 research.
LogisticResearchRemovedAllowCar=Allow Cars to request items from the logistics network. Items can no longer be removed from cars via inserters, to prevent them from acting as makeshift buffer chests. Does not require the Logistics 2 research.
LogisticResearchRemovedAllowStorageInteraction=Allows Inserters to take items from Storage Chests. If enabled, you can use them as improvised buffer chests by using a filter and telling bots to remove from Passive Provider chests.
